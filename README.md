# Reinforcement learning course

In this course, I will try to implement some of the most know algorithms in Reinforcement learning.
I will try to provide a good explanation for each code and I hope you find this course useful and reuse it in your project.
a good resource to learn Reinforcement learning :

    1-Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition *chapter 18*
    2-Reinforcement Learning An Introduction, 2nd Edition by Richard S. Sutton, Andrew G Barto

I have implement for now Q_learning Algorithm one of the oldest algorithm and Deep_Q_learning Algorithm 
I will put all Projects from this filed in this folder.
